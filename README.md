## Part 1

### User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:
- [x] User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

The following **optional** features were implemented:
- [x] Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [x] In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [x] In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

<!-- - [ ] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [ ] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones. -->
